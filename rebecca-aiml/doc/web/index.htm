                   <p>2007.09.16 - RebeccaAIML 1.1tp3 (Slatter) Released.</p><br/>
                   <p>
                   This is a bug fix version with improved internationalization support.
                   See the <a href="userGuide.htm#upgrading">userGuide</a> for instructions 
                   on upgrading.  The bug fixes are
                   </p>
                   <ul>
                   <li>Fixed a bug where escaped XML elements such as &lt; &gt; were 
                   not operating correctly.  This effected reversed aiml.</li>
                   <li>Enhanced empty conditionals where they will now correctly 
                   allow you to use an empty string for a condition and it will 
                   return true if the predicate does not exist.</li>
                   <li>Fixed a nasty bug where if you have multiple star's and multiple
                   users it would return an empty false positive string.
                   </ul>
                   <p>
                   For international support, it has been improved upon within the 
                   core engine and with the various programming languages that RebeccaAIML
                   supports.  The fixes are
                   </p>
                   <ul>
                   <li>Dialects will work with the eclipse plugin now.  The fix was within 
                   the core engine, so you only need to update RebeccaAIML and you won't 
                   need to update your eclipse plugin</li>
                   <li>The command line rs-admin tool now supports recieving dialects as 
                   well as correctly processing and outputing dialects.</li>
                   <li>Lastly, upper casing, lower casing, and formal'izing dialects will 
                   work correctly</li>
                   </ul>

                    <p>
                    This is a tech preview release to the upcomming (Slatter) series.
                    The Edmondson series has come to an end as well as some old mentalities
                    about AIML development as we know it.<br/><br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This first tech preview release is only available underneath Windows.  
                    However, I promise before the full release of 1.1, a Linux version 
                    will be available.<br/><br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Also, starting with this release RebeccaAIML will be 
                    available with a dual licensing scheme.  If you are developing 
                    commercial applications based off of RebeccaAIML you will need 
                    to purchase a commercial license.  However, if you are 
                    releasing your code underneath the GPL version 3 you can 
                    use RebeccaAIML underneath that license.<br/><br/>

                    Now that is out of the way, what does this new version 1.1tp1 
                    offer everyone?<br/><br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Well, just check out the <a href="userGuide.htm">userGuide</a> for 1.1tp1 
                    which describes each feature in great length with plenty of great 
                    screen shots.  Briefly though,
                    </p>
    			    <ul>
    			    <li>A windows installer</li>
    			    <li>An Eclipse plugin for using Eclipse as an AIML editor</li>
    			    <li>An embedded database engine for all AIML processing</li>
    			    <li>Support for a multitude of programming languages such as 
                        C++, C#, Java, and Python</li>
                    <li>Excellent, fully documented, and easy to use 
                        APIs for various programming languages</li>
    			    <li>Support for safe and concurrent multi-process access to AIML</li>
    			    <li>Support for safe and concurrent multi-threading access to AIML</li>
    			    <li>Includes command line tools to access and manipulate the AIML 
                        embedded database</li>
                    <li>Support for multiple users, multiple bots the users
                        can have, and multiple end users accessing the users' bots</li>
                    <li>Scalability.  RebeccaAIML can support an infinite number of users,
                        bots, and, end users as long as you have hard drive space for 
                        more.</li>
                    <li>Near zero start times.  Regardless of your number of users,
                        bots, end users, RebeccAIML will restart in ~ 1 second.</li>
                    <li>A configurable amount of memory.  Utilizing the embedded database 
                        tools you can configure how much memory RebeccaAIML will use for 
                        caching as well as fine tune her from a small machine to a large 
                        rack server.</li>
                    <li>Server and client model included.  RebeccaAIML starts as a service
                        and runs as a server in the background waiting for queries</li>

					I now include the executable, regression, in both the Windows 
					and Linux prebuilt packages.  This is for downloaders to be 
					able to verify the quality of Rebecca for the version they 
					download.<br/><br/>
					
					If you are not interested in the regression test suite then 
					you do not have to worry about updating to this version.  Other
					than including the regression suite, this version is identical to
					0.987.<br/><br/>

					I also added the regression test suite to the autoconf build system
					where it builds it by default.  This is for those who port RebeccaAIML 
					to another platform to be able to run regression tests to ensure the 
					quality of the port.  Use </p>
					<blockquote><p>./configure --help</p></blockquote> to see all the autoconf
					options available.<br/><br/>

					Updated the code for the regression testing.  It now uses header and 
					footer html files in resources/testing instead of having the html 
					hard coded.  Fixed the html page breaks.  I also improved it to be 
					dll boundary safe by having it use
					<blockquote><p>Tag::instanceOf()</p></blockquote>
					instead of dynamically casting through <blockquote><p>dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;()</p></blockquote>

					I also added an Arguments class to regression to enable a smooth
					transition over to autoconf

                       Condition and Li were not handling empty string cases 
                       correctly.  See the latest

                       <blockquote><p>Li::getPredicateName() and Li::getAimlPattern()</p></blockquote>

                       Added these methods to the framework on the class Li:

					<p>
                       It returns true if the Li is a name and value list.<br/><br/>
                       Added these methods to the framework on the class Condition:

                       <blockquote><p>bool Condition::isBlockCondition()</p></blockquote>

					</p>
					   <blockquote><p>PlainWordImpl::trimToOneSpace()</p></blockquote>
					<p><br/>
					   where I was not checking if the size of a string was greater

                       Fixed a bug with srai where the star indexes were not being
                       calculated right during srai.<br/><br/>

                       Fixed a bug where rebecca would not let go of her internal 
                       AIML file and string caching system.<br/><br/>

                       Upgraded the qtgui and tested it underneath QT 4.1.4<br/><br/>

                       Added the Callback method 
					 </p>
					   <blockquote><p>Callbacks::learnTagFileNotFound()</p></blockquote>
					 <p><br/>
                       for when the AIML XML learn tag cannot find a file it will 
                       call this callback.  This will allow the programmer to handle
                       file not founds for AIML XML programmatically.<br/><br/>

                       Added a new method 
					 </p>
					   <blockquote><p>GraphBuilder::callSystemCommand()</p></blockquote>
					 <p><br/>
					   which acts the same as calling the AIML XML tag "System" by sending the 
                       command to the operating system and returning the output of 
                       the command.<br/>

                       Added an Arguments class to each sample.  The purpose
                       of this is two fold.  One is to show how you could 
                       parse arguments when utilizing RebeccaAIML api and the 
                       second is to make the installers of the samples 
                       easier to write in the future.<br/><br/>

                       The Arguments class now gives a few switches with each sample.  
                       See the source code of each sample for the list of available switches.

                       Tweaked the source files to work with gcc 4.1.0<br/><br/>

                       Added RPM support to the build.  In the download section you should now

					<p>2006.04.10 - RebeccaAIML 0.984 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
                       Feature enhancement and bug fix release.<br/><br/>

                       Added the feature of being able to add AIML strings to 
                       Rebecca on the fly through the method 
					</p>
                       <blockquote><p>GraphBuilder.addString("aiml string")</p></blockquote>  
					<p><br/>
					   You can add a whole category programatically as easily as:<br/>
					</p>
<blockquote><pre>
builder.addString
(
    "&lt;category&gt;"
    "&lt;pattern&gt;test aiml string&lt;/pattern&gt;"
    "&lt;template&gt;it simply works!&lt;/template&gt;"
    "&lt;/category&gt;"
);			
</pre></blockquote>
                     <p>
                      Added the learn tag per AIML 1.0.1 specification.<br/><br/>

                      Fixed the gender, person, and person2 tag implementations 
                      to pass all of the regression tests.<br/><br/>

                      Fixed the addFile and addDirectory to be tolerant of adding
                      files which are native to the file system.  Before you could
                      at best portably use relative strings.  Now you can use just
                      about any file system string for 
					  </p>
					  <blockquote><p>GraphBuilder.addFile()</p></blockquote>
					  <p>
					  and 
					  </p>
					  <blockquote><p>GraphBuilder.addDirectory()</p></blockquote>  
					  <p>
					  As a result of this I was able to simply part of the qtGUI core to using 
					  whichever native absolute paths that came from Windows or Unix.<br/><br/>

                      See the <a href="documentation.htm">documentation </a>of these methods

					<h2>0.983 (Edmondson) Released</h2>
					<p>2006.04.04 - RebeccaAIML 0.983 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
                       Bug fix release.<br/><br/>

                       I fixed a bug reported by Charles Chevallier where
                       when srai is called the input AIML tags behaved 
                       incorrectly. To fix this bug I had to alter the signature 
                       of 
					   </p>
					   <blockquote><p>GraphBuilderFramework.checkedInfiniteLoopGetResponse()</p></blockquote>
					   <p>
                       It now has a new boolean argument variable 
                       "keepPreviousUserInput".  You set this to false if you 
                       do not want the previous user input stored internally.  
                       Usually you only want to set this to false when you call 
                       this from implementations of the Srai AIML tag.<br/><br/>

                       I fixed a bug reported by Charles Chaevallier where
                       when punctuation is at the begining of a Rebecca 
                       Response it would cause her to crash.<br/><br/>

                       I fixed a one-off error where I incorrectly indexed 
                       some of the internal data structures and this would
                       cause a crash.<br/><br/>

                       Made the stack operational thanks to a missing predicate
                       found by Ryan Neill.<br/><br/>

                       Put in more bot properties (the most common ones), thanks 
                       to Ryan Neill for pointing this out to me.

					<p>2006.03.19 - RebeccaAIML 0.982 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
					   I fixed a bug under Linux for the
					</p>
					   <blockquote>
					   <p>GraphBuilder::addCustomTagLibrary</p>
					   </blockquote>
					<p>
					   method.  It would load the string given as soname.so when it 
					   should have loaded it as libsoname.so.<br/><br/>

					   I also fixed a bug reported by Charles Chevallier where 
					   Rebecca was not erasing commas before storing strings into 
					   her internal "that" variable.  I added a regression test 
					   case for it so the bug will not reappear.<br/><br/>

					   I also fixed the "System" AIML tag to be able to return 
					   the string now under both Windows and Linux.  Now the 
					   regression test for the "System" tag works!

					<p>2006.03.04 - RebeccaAIML 0.981 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
					   Added a new cross platform simple QT GUI to the samples
					   section to showcase how you would program a GUI with
					   the RebeccaAIML engine.  You should be able to see
					   the screen shot at the top of the web page now.<br/><br/>

					   Fixed a bug where when you call new and delete on
					   AIMLFacade or StringPimpl it would crash under Windows
					   if you were mixing and matching Debug and Release.  Now,
					   new and delete are dll boundary safe.<br/><br/>

					   Forgot to put .98 in VERSION .98 for the 
					   </p>
					   <blockquote>
					   <p>
					   GraphBuilderAIML::getVersion()
					   </p>
					   </blockquote>
					   <p>
					   So, all resulting programs built using .98 will report 
					   they are version .972 when they encounter the AIML XML Tag 
					   "version". Fixed that in this version, it will say .981 when 
					   the "version" tag is encountered.

					<p>
                       I opened up the RebeccaAIML framework in which you can
					   inherit from AIML XML Tag classes to add or modify the
					   current working set.  You will need Boost C++ library
					   to use the framework.  With the release of the framework
					   you can now add your own custom AIML XML Tag dll or shared
					   object in which you can change the functionality of the 
					   engine.  The framework is fully documented and I provide
					   a sample which overrides all the AIML XML Tags to provide
					   a html converter.  It converts AIML XML files into html pages 
					   with links.  The html pages provide a way to "cruise" 
					   through the AIML brain and see how the brain would look like 
					   in memory.<br/><br/>

					   You can see a sample of how the converter works by first 
					   looking at this basic AIML file 
					   <a href="samples/consoleHtmlConverter/aimlFile.xml">aiml file</a>
					   and the resulting html files from the converter, 
					   <a href="samples/consoleHtmlConverter/htmlAiml/%5Broot%5D.html">html convertered</a>

					   Copy constructor of StringPimpl was not setting its 
					   private implementation handle to 0 and when it was 
					   called it would try to delete and in turn crash 
					   RebeccaAIML.<br/><br/>
					   I also changed the default precompiled windows 
					   binary to be multithreaded dll instead of just 
					   multithreaded.

					   Enabled true multi-lined that's.  Now Rebecca can pass
					   another regression test involving multi-lined that's.  See
					   documentation for the regression test results.
					   Also now the "That" index's involving previous input's and
					   previous sentences works correctly.

					<h2>0.97 (Edmondson) Released</h2>
					<p>2005.11.06 - RebeccaAIML 0.97 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
					   A new regression testing system has been put into place.
					   The regression test suite is that of ProgramD's.  However,
					   in the future I will add more test cases which should work
					   for both the test regression suite here and for ProgramD's.
					   How that is accomplished is through the use of xml to define
					   the test cases.  This is all from the work of Joel on ProgramD.
					   From the regression testing, I have found bugs and made more 
					   fixes to this release.  I also have found a few bugs which I will 
					   fix in an upcomming release.

					   This release fixes yet another bug with the condition 
					   tag.  The condition tag before only accepted AIML tags 
					   for the result of a succesful condition.  Now regular text 
					   can be added as well to the condition tag as it should be.  I also 
					   fixed up white space problems with this release as well as made
					   the exceptions of FileNotFound and DirectoryNotFound more verbose.

					<h2>RebeccaAIML 0.96 (Edmondson) Released</h2>
					<p>2005.10.20 - RebeccaAIML 0.96 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
					   This release fixes a bug in which the AIML tag "Condition" 
					   did not work at all.  Also this release fixes the AIML.xsd.
					   Therefore, I have enabled Schema validation in this release.

					   With schema validation enabled, bad AIML tags will be reported 
					   to their respective callbacks and the XML parser automatically
					   handles not adding bad AIML to the graph builder.  Thus your 
					   callbacks will alert you to bad AIML tags, and your graph builder
					   should still remain bullet proof. See the 
					   <a href="documentation.htm">documentation</a> for 
					   more details on XML callbacks through the class CallBacks.

					<p>
					   A minor bug fix version.<br/><br/>

					   Fixed the "muliti-lined that" bug.  This bug was minor 
					   but an annoyance.  Whenver a "that" has more than one line
					   the last line should be choosen as the that.

					<h2>0.95 (Edmondson) Released</h2>
					<p>2005.10.12 - RebeccaAIML 0.95 (Edmondson) Released</p><br/>
					<p>
					   Initial release.  All AIML tags are implemented except 
					   for the "learn" Tag and the java script.<br/><br/>

					   There is currently a bug with the AIML.xsd that does 
					   not allow the AIML tag "Set" to validate correctly.  So
					   for the time being I have removed the AIML.xsd validation
					   but will put it back as soon as that is fixed.
