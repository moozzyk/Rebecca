* WELCOME!

This is the RebeccaAIML Project.  

RebeccaAIML is an enterprise cross platform open source 
AIML development platform. RebeccaAIML supports C++, Java,
C#, and Python as well as many other programming languages
and AIML development out of the box.  RebeccaAIML also 
comes with an array of AIML administration tools, great 
documentation, and an eclipse AIML editor plugin.

* RUNNING THE PRECOMPILED SAMPLES AND ADMIN TOOLS

Want to see what RebeccaAIML can do?  If you downloaded a 
binary distribution you can run the precompiled 
samples that show off RebeccaAIML's API cabilities.  

Under Windows you can find and run the samples from 
[bin\xxx] where xxx is a programming language.  
Under Linux you can find and run the samples 
from [/usr/bin]

The rs-admin Tool is under the [bin\cpp] folder.  This is 
the admin tool that can do anything by command line you could
do with a programming language

Note for Linux:  The samples in [/usr/bin] are shell scripts 
that execute the binaries in [/usr/share/Rebecca/bin/xxx] where
xxx is a programming language.  This is so you can execute 
the binaries from anywhere in the system and don't have to 
be in the actual binary's directory.

For more information about the samples see the README.txt's in 
[bin\xxx] where xxx is a programming language under Windows 
and [/usr/share/Rebecca/bin/xxx] under Linux.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* PROGRAMMING WITH THE API AND FRAMEWORK

So how do you start programming with the API and/or framework?  
For a quick start check out the source code of the samples.  
Under Windows you'll find them under [src\samples].  Under Linux 
you'll find them under [/usr/share/Rebecca/src/samples].  Each 
sample has a build file for both Windows and Linux.

See the README.txt in the samples directory for more information 
about the samples.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE APIs AND FRAMEWORK

Where's the full documentation of the APIs and FRAMEWORK at?  You can 
find the documentation of the api and framework in the [doc] directory.
Under Windows that's [doc] and under Linux that's  
[/usr/share/Rebecca/doc]

You can also find more documentation at the RebeccaAIML website: 
http://rebecca-aiml.sourceforge.net/documentation.htm

------------------------------------------------------------------

* COMPILING THE SOURCE CODE OF THE ENGINE

I want to compile the complete source code of the engine and not 
just the samples.  How do I do that?

See [doc\windowsInstall.txt] for Windows and 
[/usr/share/Rebecca/doc/linuxInstall.txt] for Linux.

------------------------------------------------------------------

* DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE DIRECTORIES AND FILES

Can you give me an overview of all the files and directories of 
RebeccaAIML?  Under Windows these files are located at 
[<wherever_you_installed>\...] and under Linux these files are 
located at [/usr/share/Rebecca]

If you have the source or binary distribution you
have the following directories of:

[aiml]      Varoius AIML data sets that are included 
            with the RebeccaAIML distribution and used 
			by the samples.

[bin]       Where Rebecca's binaries are located underneath 
            Windows.  Also where the prebuilt sample(s) 
			and executables are built into. 

[conf]      Various configuration files that the samples
            use when they load.

[doc]       Where all the documentation is located. 
            Everything from the API documentation, user guide,
            to how to install Rebecca from full source 
            code is here.

[include]   All the include files for building against 
            RebeccaAIML with C++.  
            			
[resources] Various resource files needed by every sample 
            is located here.  
			
[src]       Source code of samples and the RebeccaAIML 
            engine if you downloaded the source code.

If you have the source code distribution you have 
a few extra added directories of:

[build_files]           Where the various visual studio 
                        build files and Linux build files 
						are.

[src/rebecca]           Source code of the engine			  

[include/rebecca/impl]  Header files only needed for building
                        the engine.			  

[rebecca.spec]          The RPM spec file in which to build 
                        an RPM of Rebecca for your platform.  
						See  [/usr/share/Rebecca/doc/linuxInstall.txt] 
						for more details on how to utilize this.
